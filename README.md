# Predictive-Analysis-of-Bank-Loan-Approvals
Predictive Analysis of Bank Loan Approvals
Main Summary
The project aims to predict the likelihood of loan repayment by bank customers.
Leveraging machine learning techniques to identify customers capable of repaying loans, assisting the bank in making informed lending decisions and mitigating the risk of default.
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Clean the data by handling missing values, correcting errors, and encoding categorical variables.
Perform feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones that might improve predictive performance.
Outcome
The outcome of the project reveals that the occupation type labeled as unknown demonstrates the highest occurrence among both defaulted and non-defaulted loans. Despite lacking clarity or specific categorization, applicants associated with this group exhibit a notable presence in the loan application dataset, warranting further investigation into their characteristics and potential risk factors.
